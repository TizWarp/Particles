### A broken physics solver

Can technically support arround 1000 particles but the solver kinds sucks so doesnt behave quite right
G -> toggle gravity
Q -> toggle quad tree overlay

the Quad tree could use some work as well;

## Compiling

#### Linux
- Make sure sfml is located on your system
- Install cmake/make
- run cmake ./
- run make
- run ParticleSim executable

#### Windows
